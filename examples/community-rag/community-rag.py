Key aspects of the paper implemented in this code:

1. Knowledge Graph Structure: The KnowledgeGraph class represents the paper's emphasis on using KGs to capture complex entity relationships.

2. Community Detection: The get_community_structure method implements the paper's suggestion of using community detection (Louvain algorithm) to identify clusters of related information.

3. Community-Based Retrieval: The retrieve_context method in CommunityKGRAG class demonstrates the paper's novel approach of using community structures for context retrieval.

4. Integration with LLM: The verify_claim method shows how the retrieved context is used with a language model (GPT-4) for fact-checking, as proposed in the paper.

5. Zero-Shot Framework: The implementation doesn't require additional training, aligning with the paper's emphasis on a zero-shot approach.

Areas for further development (as mentioned in the paper):
- Implement more sophisticated embedding models for similarity calculation.
- Expand the knowledge graph with comprehensive data from fact-checking articles.
- Enhance the community detection and selection process.
- Improve the context retrieval mechanism to better utilize multi-hop relationships.

This prototype serves as a proof-of-concept for the CommunityKG-RAG approach, demonstrating its potential in enhancing fact-checking through the integration of structured knowledge and language models.
