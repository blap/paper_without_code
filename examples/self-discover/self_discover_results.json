By applying physics, optics, and understanding atmospheric science, the explanation becomes clear. In Step 1, applying physics, we recognize that sunlight is composed of various colors with different wavelengths. In Step 2, applying optics, we understand that these colors scatter differently based on their wavelengths when they enter the Earth's atmosphere. Blue light, having shorter wavelengths, scatters more than red light with longer wavelengths. In Step 3, applying atmospheric science, the scattered blue light is directed in different directions and spreads across the sky, making it appear blue to our eyes. Synthesizing these findings, we conclude that the sky's blue color is a result of the scattering of sunlight by the molecules in the Earth's atmosphere, which affects shorter wavelengths (blue) more than longer wavelengths (red)."

The kinematic equation v = u + at can be rearranged to solve for t where v = 0. \n\nStep 2: Apply Gravity Calculation: Using the equation v = u + at (0 = 20 - 9.8t), we solve for t. From this, t = 20 / 9.8 \u2248 2.04 seconds. To determine the maximum height, we use the equation s = ut + (1/2)at^2 where s is the displacement.

This energy is used to split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen atoms. The oxygen is released as a byproduct, while the hydrogen atoms are used to convert carbon dioxide into glucose through a series of reactions known as the Calvin cycle.\n\nStep 3: Apply Ecological Impact Analysis: Photosynthesis is crucial for life on Earth for several reasons.

Moreover, the Agricultural Revolution had increased food production, leading to population growth and a surplus labor force that could be employed in factories.\n\nStep 3: Apply Economic Theory: \nEconomically, the Industrial Revolution introduced mass production and specialization of labor, which significantly increased productivity and reduced costs. The development of factories led to economies of scale. The capitalist economic model was bolstered, with private ownership leading to profit-driven industrial growth and increased investment in infrastructure and technology.\n\nStep 4: Apply Sociopolitical Analysis: \nSocio-politically, the Industrial Revolution had profound impacts. There was a rise of urbanization as people moved to cities for factory work, changing family structures and social dynamics. Labor conditions were often poor, leading to the emergence of labor unions and labor laws. Politically, it catalyzed changes such as increased political activism among the working class and influenced policies promoting industrial growth and worker rights.\n\nFinal Step: Synthesize findings and conclude: \nIn summary, the Industrial Revolution was a multi-faceted historical event caused by technological, economic, and social factors. Its consequences were profound, leading to economic growth, societal changes, and political reforms. It transformed economies from agrarian to industrial, reshaped social structures through urbanization and labor shifts, and set the stage for modern economic and political developments."
