The paper introduces REAPER (Reasoning-based PlannER), a groundbreaking lightweight language model-based planner designed to enhance the efficiency of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, specifically tailored for complex dialog scenarios such as the Amazon Rufus shopping chatbot. REAPER approach addresses the slowness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks effectively. This research stands out by addressing the significant latency issues that plague traditional RAG systems. REAPER achieves an impressive reduction in retrieval plan latency to 207 milliseconds—compared to 2 seconds per step in current models—without sacrificing accuracy, thereby making it highly suitable for real-time applications where response speed is critical. The paper reports REAPER’s high accuracy rates, with 95% in tool selection and 92% in argument generation, illustrating that smaller LLMs can perform effectively in these tasks. Moreover, REAPER’s scalability with minimal training data—requiring only 286 examples to add new retrieval sources—demonstrates its practical applicability and efficiency. Its innovative data generation techniques, such as Tool Evolve (TEvo), Tool-Task Generator (TTG), and Diverse Query Sampler (DQS), ensure robustness and diversity, combating issues of model bias. These advancements not only enhance conversational AI but also set a new benchmark in the field, making the paper invaluable for researchers and practitioners aiming to optimize dialog systems. Future research could explore the application of REAPER across various domains and further its integration with other AI systems to dynamically adapt to evolving user needs.
