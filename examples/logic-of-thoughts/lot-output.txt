The Simpsons are preparing a concert show with tricks, a guitar song, and one family member’s own poem.
A person who wrote the poem will give a bread machine as a present and buy irises.
Mummy will buy tulips.
Melanie has learned to bake cinnamon buns and remembered guitar chords for Granny’s birthday.
The trickster has prepared a notebook for recipes and a fruit salad.
Melanie knows that Granny likes daisies.
A person who will give a rocking chair will also prepare homemade candies for Granny.
Bill has a special deck of cards and a box with a double bottom.
Mummy and Melanie have had rehearsals for two for a week.
Daddy will prepare orange juice.
Granny will also be given a bouquet of roses and a ticket to the theatre play.

Who will give a theatre ticket and who will buy roses?

Logical Reasoning Process:
The logical expressions can be interpreted as a series of conditional statements and relationships that highlight various gift-giving scenarios and their resulting emotional impacts. 

1. The first expression states that if the poem is written (P2), then it leads to actions where a bread machine and irises are given, resulting in happiness for the recipient.
2. The second expression illustrates that if Granny receives a theatre ticket and roses (P11), it guarantees a joyful evening. 
3. The third expression asserts that if the person performs tricks, a guitar song, and a family member's poem at the concert (P1), this combination creates a memorable experience for attendees. 
4. The fourth expression indicates that giving Granny a rocking chair along with homemade candies (P7) will evoke a sense of nostalgia.
5. The fifth expression connects the actions of writing the poem and Granny receiving her gifts, suggesting that this thoughtful exchange indicates the consideration behind the gifts.
6. The sixth expression shows that the combination of the concert elements and homemade candies contributes positively to family bonding during their celebration.
7. Finally, the last expression notes that whether Granny receives gifts or the poem is written, both scenarios result in celebratory occasions. 

Overall, these expressions collectively describe a series of thoughtful gestures and their intended emotional outcomes, illustrating how different actions and gifts foster happiness, nostalgia, and celebration within familial relationships.

Solution:
To solve the puzzle, we will analyze the available clues systematically.

### Clues Breakdown
1. **The person who wrote the poem will give a bread machine and buy irises.**
2. **Mummy will buy tulips.**
3. **Melanie has learned to bake cinnamon buns and remembered guitar chords for Granny’s birthday.**
4. **The trickster has prepared a notebook for recipes and a fruit salad.**
5. **Melanie knows that Granny likes daisies.**
6. **The person who will give a rocking chair will prepare homemade candies for Granny.**
7. **Bill has a special deck of cards and a box with a double bottom.**
8. **Mummy and Melanie have had rehearsals for two for a week.**
9. **Daddy will prepare orange juice.**
10. **Granny will also be given a bouquet of roses and a ticket to the theatre play.**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Identifying gift givers:** 
   - We know **Mummy** is buying **tulips**, so she is **not** involved in giving the theatre ticket or roses.
   - **Daddy will prepare orange juice**, so he is not involved in giving gifts.
   - This leaves **Melanie**, **Granny**, and **Bill** as possible givers of the theatre ticket and roses.

2. **Understanding who gives what:**
   - The person who gives the **rocking chair** is also preparing **homemade candies** for Granny. This does not give information about the theatre ticket or roses.
   - It’s clear that *the theatre ticket and roses might be given by a different family member since the first clue ("the person who will give a rocking chair") doesn't mention either of these gifts.*

3. **Linking to Granny's gifts:**
   - Granny receives **both a bouquet of roses and a ticket to the theatre play**. Therefore, whoever gives these gifts must be a family member of Granny.
   - Since Mummy is giving tulips and Daddy is preparing juice, they are excluded from giving the theatre ticket and roses.

4. **Who is left?**
   - The only plausible gift givers remaining are **Melanie** and **Bill**.
   - Given the clues about Melanie preparing for Granny’s birthday and her knowledge of Granny's favorite flowers (daisies), it seems more fitting that **Bill is likely to give a theatre ticket or roses.**
  
5. **Final conclusions:**
   - Since Granny can receive a mix of roses and a ticket with established familiarity to the family, we can conclude that **Bill** gives the **theatre ticket** and **Melanie** gives **roses** to ensure a harmonious memory of the celebrations.

### Final Answer
**Bill will give a theatre ticket, and Melanie will buy roses.**
