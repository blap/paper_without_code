Solving Einstein's Riddle using Logic-of-Thought approach:

The Simpsons are preparing a concert show with tricks, a guitar song, and one family member’s own poem.
A person who wrote the poem will give a bread machine as a present and buy irises.
Mummy will buy tulips.
Melanie has learned to bake cinnamon buns and remembered guitar chords for Granny’s birthday.
The trickster has prepared a notebook for recipes and a fruit salad.
Melanie knows that Granny likes daisies.
A person who will give a rocking chair will also prepare homemade candies for Granny.
Bill has a special deck of cards and a box with a double bottom.
Mummy and Melanie have had rehearsals for two for a week.
Daddy will prepare orange juice.
Granny will also be given a bouquet of roses and a ticket to the theatre play.

Who will give a theatre ticket and who will buy roses?

Logical Reasoning Process:
The logical reasoning process can be summarized as follows:

1. The first expression states that if Mummy buys tulips and Grandma gets them, then it ensures that someone will give her a theatre ticket. Furthermore, receiving a theatre ticket implies that she will receive a surprise gift. Therefore, we conclude that if Mummy buys tulips and Grandma gets them, someone will ultimately receive a surprise gift.

2. The second expression indicates that if a person wrote a poem, it leads to them giving a bread machine and buying irises. Additionally, if they buy irises, it follows that they will donate the poem. Hence, we deduce that if a person wrote a poem, they will both give a bread machine and donate the poem.

3. The third expression implies that if a person gives a rocking chair, then they will prepare homemade candies for Granny. Subsequently, preparing homemade candies results in Granny expressing gratitude. Thus, we can conclude that if a person gives a rocking chair, they will also receive gratitude from Granny.

Overall, this process illustrates how certain actions lead to specific outcomes through a chain of logical implications, reinforcing the interconnectedness of these statements in a structured manner.

Solution:
To determine who will give a theatre ticket and who will buy roses, let's analyze the clues provided step-by-step.

1. **Identifying Key Characters and Items**:
   - Mummy: will buy tulips.
   - Melanie: has learned to bake cinnamon buns, remembers guitar chords, and knows Granny likes daisies.
   - Granny: will receive roses and a theatre ticket.
   - One family member wrote a poem, will give a bread machine, and buy irises.
   - A person giving a rocking chair will prepare homemade candies for Granny.
   - Daddy: will prepare orange juice.
   - Bill: has a special deck of cards and a box with a double bottom.

2. **Focus on Key Gifts for Granny**:
   - Granny will receive a theatre ticket and a bouquet of roses.
   - Let's break down who could give these gifts.

3. **Analyzing the Gifts**:
   - Mummy is already committed to buying tulips, so she cannot be the one giving roses or the theatre ticket.
   - The only mention of roses is that Granny will receive a bouquet. We deduce that the bouquet of roses will most likely be bought by someone other than Mummy.
   - The theatre ticket isn't directly associated with any one character but must come from someone involved in the concert preparations.

4. **Linking the Gifts to Family Members**:
   - The person who gives Granny the rocking chair will prepare homemade candies. This isn't necessarily tied to the roses or the theatre ticket.
   - Mummy and Melanie have been rehearsing together, indicating a strong collaborative relationship. However, Mummy's commitment to tulips limits her role.

5. **Final Deductions**:
   - Since Melanie knows that Granny likes daisies, it’s logical she wouldn’t choose roses. However, she does not have a defined gift role yet.
   - Bill's specific mentions of his items imply he may not be focused on the concert gifts. This could suggest he is out from giving the tickets too.
   - Given that Daddy prepares orange juice but does not have mention of a gift, we can tentatively eliminate him from the theatre ticket or roses.

Putting it all together:

- The person giving the **theatre ticket** must be the one coordinating the surprise aspect of gifts since they are preparing for the concert.
- Mummy cannot be giving roses, and as such, it reverts back to either Melanie or a combination with Bill.

Since Granny is set to receive roses and irises from the poem-writer:

- **Conclusion**:
  - Bill must end up buying the **roses**, leaving Melanie or another family member to give the **theatre ticket**.

Thus, we can reasonably state based on the context:
- **Final answer**: Bill will buy the roses, while the theatre ticket will be given by Melanie.
