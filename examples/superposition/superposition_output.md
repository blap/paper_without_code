Answer: The main causes of climate change are:

1. **Emissions of Carbon Dioxide (CO2)**: CO2 is the primary greenhouse gas emitted through human activities, mainly from the combustion of fossil fuels for energy and transportation. In 2019, CO2 accounted for about 80% of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from human activities.

The main effects of climate change are:

1. **Rising Global Sea Levels**: Since reliable record keeping began in 1880, global sea levels have risen about 8 inches. It is projected to rise another 1 to 8 feet by 2100 due to added water from melting land ice and the expansion of seawater as it warms.
2. **Greenhouse Effect**

Answer: The greenhouse effect contributes to global warming by trapping heat close to Earth's surface through greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, preventing heat from escaping into space. As a result, the trapped heat keeps the planet warmer than it would be without these gases. Human activities, particularly the combustion of fossil fuels for energy and transportation, have significantly increased the concentration of these greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This enhances the natural greenhouse effect, leading to an overall increase in Earth's temperatures and contributing to global warming.

Answer: Although the provided text does not directly address the projected consequences of sea level rise and ocean acidification, these issues are closely tied to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). Here are some commonly reported projected consequences:

### Sea Level Rise:
1. **Coastal Erosion and Flooding**: Increasing sea levels can lead to more frequent and severe coastal erosion and flooding. Low-lying areas may be especially vulnerable to storm surges.
2. **Loss of Habitat**: Rising seas can inundate coastal habitats, affecting biodiversity and ecosystems such as mangroves, wetlands, and coral reefs.
3. **Displacement of People**: Coastal communities may be forced to relocate due to persistent flooding and loss of land.

Generating final response...
Answer: Climate change affects weather patterns and biodiversity in several significant ways:

1. **Weather Patterns**:
   - **Increased Temperature**: Long-term shifts in temperature mean that regions can experience more intense heat waves and warmer periods.
   - **Altered Precipitation**: Changes in climate can lead to more extreme and irregular precipitation patterns, resulting in more frequent and intense storms, floods, or extended dry periods and droughts.
   - **Extreme Weather Events**: The frequency and intensity of extreme weather events like hurricanes, typhoons, and tornadoes can increase due to the warming climate.
   - **Seasonal Shifts**: The timing of seasons can shift, affecting agricultural practices and natural cycles.

2. **Biodiversity**

Answer: The evidence supporting the claim that human activities are the main driver of recent climate change includes:

1. **Primary Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: Carbon dioxide (CO2) is identified as the primary greenhouse gas emitted through human activities. In 2019, CO2 accounted for about 80 percent of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from human activities.
  
2. **Main Source of CO2 Emissions**: The main human activity that emits CO2 is the combustion of fossil fuels for energy and transportation.

3. **Impact of Greenhouse Gases**: Greenhouse gases, such as CO2, trap heat close to Earth's surface, functioning like a blanket that keeps the planet warmer than it would be without them.
