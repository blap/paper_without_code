# Agents Thinking Fast and Slow: A Talker-Reasoner Architecture
## Research Question/Objective
- Explore the application of dual-system cognitive theory to AI agents
- Develop an architecture with "Talker" and "Reasoner" for AI systems

## Methodology
### Dual-System Architecture
- "Talker" handles fast, intuitive tasks
- "Reasoner" manages slow, deliberate reasoning
### Use Case
- Implemented in a sleep coaching agent
### Evaluation
- Qualitative assessment of performance in sleep coaching

## Key Findings/Contributions
- Introduction of a Talker-Reasoner AI architecture inspired by human cognition
- Demonstrated practical use in a sleep coaching AI agent
- Showcased modularity and reduced latency benefits

## Theoretical Framework
- Based on Kahneman’s dual-system theory of cognition
- System 1 ("Talker") for fast responses
- System 2 ("Reasoner") for complex tasks

## Results and Discussion
### Qualitative Results
#### Example Conversations
- Demonstrated incorporation of user feedback into planning
#### Success and Failure Modes
- Talker effective for straightforward tasks
- Reasoner necessary for complex problem-solving
### Discussion of Results
- Success in fast conversational tasks
- Challenges in asynchronous dual-agent system

## Implications
- Suggests improvements in agent interaction by mimicking human cognition
- Potential application across various domains requiring dynamic dual processing

## Limitations
- Focused primarily on qualitative results, lacking in quantitative analysis
- Complexity may introduce unnecessary overhead for certain tasks
- Limited to a singular use case, affecting generalizability

## Future Research Directions
- Expansion of architecture to include multiple "Reasoners"
- Explore adaptive mechanisms for interaction between Talker and Reasoner
- Test architecture in diverse application domains beyond sleep coaching
